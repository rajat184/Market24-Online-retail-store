CREATE
	TRIGGER update_average_delivery_rating_after_insert AFTER INSERT
	ON rates_order_delivery
	FOR EACH ROW

		SET average_rating = (SELECT AVG(Rating_Given)
				      FROM rates_order_delivery
				      WHERE rates_order_delivery.Delivery_Boy_ID=NEW.Delivery_Boy_ID)
		WHERE Delivery_Boy_ID = NEW.Delivery_Boy_ID;
	END$$

	FOR EACH ROW
	BEGIN
