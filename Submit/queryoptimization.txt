QUERY OPTIMIZATION

While writing all of our queries we have made sure they are optimized for performance and are not redundant and they are not unnecessarily complicating the running times and computation.
There are some of the standard query optimization techniques we have used while writing our queries

1.Creating Index on all the columns where we are frequently using the where clause, group by and order by  in queries

2.Avoiding select * from in query as it is time consuming and instead searching for only that information which we mainly need

3.Whenever we had any doubt in performance of our query we used explain format=json along with query to compare running time and indexing between two similar queries with different implementation

4.Similar attributes across different tables have used same datatype with similar size for faster performance if we use union and join operations so they utilize undexing properly

5.Avoiding aggregate/functional clause in where because it substantially increases the running time instead wherever required we have used views or pre calculated that data.

6.Replacing all OR in our queries in where by UNION as OR is very slow in performance

7.Keeping all the queries in same case for better cache performance as it is useful in query optimization

8.Ensuring that we donâ€™t use any OUTER JOIN as the default JOIN which means INNER JOIN is faster than OUTER JOIN

9.Wherever possible using views to make the actual query simpler and faster

10.Using NOT EXISTS instead of NOT IN as it is faster in one of our queries
